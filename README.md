For all periods the grade is divided into: Co-evaluation (10 %), self-evaluation (10 %), and teacher evaluation (80 %) which is divided into exams (40 %) and assignments (40 %). The first and second periods are 35 % of the final grade, while for the last period it is 30 %. In the first and second periods the exam consists of two tests: one practical (60 %) and the other theoretical (40 %). 


**Note:** You can practice and complement the course by solving programming problems in any of the following pages:

- [Codeabbey](https://www.codeabbey.com/)
- [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

Each problem solved, that pass all the test created for the page, can be change by points. Very simple problems are not valid.
